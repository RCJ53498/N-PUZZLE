# N-PUZZLE
A star algorithm 

This study presents a comprehensive exploration of the
state space tree structure as applied to the generic search problem in
the context of number puzzles. The state space tree serves as a
foundational framework for understanding the various configurations
and transitions within a number puzzle, facilitating the systematic
exploration of potential solutions. We delve into the properties and
characteristics of state space trees, including their branching factors,
depth, and the implications of these factors on the efficiency of search
algorithms. By employing various search strategies—such as depthfirst search, breadth-first search, and heuristic-based approaches—we
analyze their performance in navigating the state space tree. The
findings illustrate the strengths and limitations of each method,
providing insights into optimal search strategies for solving number
puzzles. This report contributes to the broader field of artificial
intelligence and algorithm design, offering valuable perspectives for
both theoretical exploration and practical application in puzzle-solving
scenarios
